This blog is trying to figure out the big picture about automating/simplifying programming with the necessary details. 
It focuses on three aspects:
(1) Keep asking why this is the real problem to solve?
(2) Keep track of the related research conducted by both academia and industry.
(3) Keep an eye on the relatively mature tools and startups that show the potential to solve a specific problem.
</p>
<p>
This blog is also serving as a channel to communicate with those who share the same interests.
Do not hesitate to debug my thought if you find something missing or wrong.

    <!--h2><a href="/portfolio/blog/2020/home-they-brought/">Home They Brought Her Warrior Dead</a></h2>
    <p>Home they brought her warrior dead:
She nor swooned, nor uttered cry:
All her maidens, watching, said,
‘She must weep or she will die.’
</p>
  
    <h2><a href="/portfolio/blog/2019/jelly-fish/">A Jelly-Fish</a></h2>
    <p>Visible, invisible,
A fluctuating charm, An amber-colored amethyst Inhabits it; your arm
Approaches, and It opens and It closes; You have meant To catch it,
And it shrivels; You abandon Your intent— It opens, and it Closes and you
Reach for it The blue Surrounding it Grows cloudy, and It floats away From you.
</p>
  
    <h2><a href="/portfolio/blog/2019/some-more/">Another sample post</a></h2>
    <p>He had three simple rules by which he lived. The first was to never eat blue food. There was nothing in nature that was edible that was blue. People often asked about blueberries, but everyone knows those are actually purple. He understood it was one of the stranger rules to live by, but it had served him well thus far in the 50+ years of his life.
</p>
  
    <h2><a href="/portfolio/blog/2018/atticus/">A sample post</a></h2>
    <p>Truly it was a great journey, and in it I met with many, whom to know was to love; but whom never could I see again; for life has not space enough; and each must do his duty to the security and well-being of the Redoubt. Yet, for all that I have set down, we travelled much, always; but there were so many millions, and so few years.
